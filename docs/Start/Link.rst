Install Blender
---------------

Download Blender 2.91 or above from blender.org (either install version or portable version).

Install Mixer

VRtist uses Mixer to get the content of a Blender scene and to synchronize it with Unity.

see: https://github.com/ubisoft/mixer

Mixer is a standard Blender addon. Install it like any other addon.

    * Go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons
    * Click the install... button and search "mixer.zip"
    * Activate the add-on by checking the "Collaboration Mixer" item

How to Launch the Live Link
---------------------------

Open your scene in Blender. In the 3D Viewport, press "N" to open the Mixer addon. Enter the VRtist.exe path.

Launch or join a server, create or join a room and press "Launch VRtist". Put your headset and enjoy!

A Windows firewall popup may appear during the first launch, accept it.

When done, everything that you did in VRtist is in your Blender scene. You can continue to work on it and relaunch VRtist anytime you want.
