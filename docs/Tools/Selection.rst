| To use the deletion tool, click the |EraserIcon| icon and select an object. When the deletion tool is active the mouthpiece will be red.
| Delete all selected items with the “Delete Selection” button.
| To deform an item, after ticking the “Deform the selected items” checkbox, move the secondary controller to one side of the object’s selection box, and press the trigger to drag that side. To deform the object uniformly along all sides, tick the “Uniform scale” checkbox.
| Ticking Snap will make the selection box of objects being moved stick to the selection box of a close object. The snapping detection can be limited to surfaces facing upwards with the “snap to ground only” checkbox.
