| The asset bank tool is used to add objects to the scene.
| To add an object, target it with the laser, then use the grip to drag it into the scene.
| Use the icons at the bottom of the asset panel to browse all available assets.
| Use the secondary controller with the grip to place the object. Change the size of the object by moving the joystick up and down on the secondary controller.
| 
| Use the duplicate button instead of releasing the grip to add multiple instances of the same object.
| 
| The assets available in the asset bank, are a list of predefined objects. To add an object to the asset bank, add the .fbx file into the default asset folder.
| The folder location can be found in the settings screen.
