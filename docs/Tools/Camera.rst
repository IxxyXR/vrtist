| The camera tool is used to add a camera in the scene.
| To add a new camera, drag the camera model into the scene. A panel displaying the camera’s view will appear showing the point of view of the camera at the position of the camera.
| 
| The right panel displays all cameras present in the scene.
| 
| The middle panel displays available options for the selected camera.
| The focal and damping can be directly edited using the sliders.
| The focal can also be changed using the slider at the bottom of the camera view panel.
| 
| To edit the depth of field, first click the checkbox. 
| The Focus and aperture can be defined using the sliders.
| To define the focus distance, drag the depth-of-field sphere to the desired distance.
